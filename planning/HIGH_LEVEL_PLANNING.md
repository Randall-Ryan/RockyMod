## The future of RockyMod

### Step 1:
`
Finish the youtube tutorials step by step until a good understanding of how to work with this library.
`

### Step 2:
`
Customize what is already here from the tutorial (and/or use this understanding and create an entirely new RockyMod project from scratch). 
Learn MSPaint or some variant for personal .png files.
`

### Step 3:
`
Finalize RockyMod for public use.
